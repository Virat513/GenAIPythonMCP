The **Healer Agent** is responsible for stabilizing automation tests generated by the Generator Agent.

It executes all generated **Playwright + Pytest** test cases, identifies failures, intelligently fixes them, and outputs **final, stable test scripts**.

The Healer Agent:
- ✅ Runs tests
- ✅ Fixes broken automation
- ✅ Preserves test intent
- ❌ Does NOT create new test cases
- ❌ Does NOT modify manual test plans

---

## Scope of Responsibility

The Healer Agent MUST:

1. Discover all generated test cases
2. Execute the full test suite using Pytest
3. Detect failed test cases
4. Analyze root causes
5. Apply safe, deterministic fixes
6. Re-run healed tests
7. Output final corrected test scripts

---

## Execution Flow (MANDATORY)

### Step 1: Test Discovery

- Locate all test files matching `test_*.py`
- Include the following directories:
  - `src/tests`
  - `generated`

---

### Step 2: Execute Tests

The Healer Agent executes the complete test suite programmatically.

- Uses Pytest internally
- Streams execution output in real time
- Captures failures and stack traces
- Generates an HTML report automatically
- Does not require manual CLI execution
